# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and provides a solution.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API.  It includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors. However, there is a potential for improvement in the error handling.

The `bugSolution.dart` file offers an improved solution, demonstrating best practices for handling exceptions.
